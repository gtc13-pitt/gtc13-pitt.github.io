            <h3>CivWiz</h3>
            <p>Here's the abstract from our group's technical report.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                "This technical report describes the redesign and development of CivWiz, a civics learning application
                originally built as a stand-alone quiz game, into a classroom-ready platform that
                better supports structured instruction for younger learners. Our central question was how to transform
                an outdated, socially oriented app into a modern system that teachers can meaningfully use in classrooms
                without sacrificing the benefits of gamified learning. <br><br> At the start of the academic year,
                CivWiz
                lacked any classroom infrastructure and relied on a public posting feature that functioned like a
                lightweight social media feed, raising moderation and safety concerns and distracting from the app’s
                core purpose. In response, our team clarified requirements with the client, evaluated the existing
                functionality, and proposed major structural changes that prioritized classroom use over open social
                interaction. <br><br> We implemented these changes using an iterative, client-driven design and
                development
                process. First, we created and refined Figma wireframes to define user flows for two primary roles:
                student and teacher. We then rebuilt the application using Flutter (Dart) with Firebase as the backend.
                On top of this, we redesigned major interfaces—including landing, play, leaderboard, settings, and
                classroom pages—to introduce a brighter, more approachable visual style and simplify navigation for
                younger users.
                <br><br> Finally, we conducted user testing sessions with university students, collecting screen
                recordings,
                surveys, and group reflections to identify bugs, usability issues, and desired future features. Our
                results show that the system now supports core classroom functions: teachers can create classes, approve
                join requests, assign and review quizzes, monitor performance, and 3 moderate embership; while students
                can join classes, complete assignments, view progress and missed questions, and see both global and
                class-specific leaderboards. Regular users are still able to complete quizzes and make progress within
                the app, but to experience the full breadth of the app, users are recommended to join a classroom.
                <br><br>
                The app is fully functional in beta and packaged with documentation for continued development, including
                a catalog of known bugs and user-requested enhancements such as daily challenges, unlockables, and
                improved admin support. <br><br> This work matters because it demonstrates how a narrowly focused,
                subject-specific learning game can be systematically restructured into a lightweight companion to
                traditional learning management systems, providing teachers with actionable data and control while
                preserving the motivational benefits of play for civics education."
